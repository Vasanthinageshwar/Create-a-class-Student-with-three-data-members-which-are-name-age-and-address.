Create a class 'Student' with three data members which are name, age and address. The constructor of the class assigns default
values name as "unknown", age as '0' and address as "not available". It has two members with the same name 'setInfo'. First
method has two parameters for name and age (setInfo(name,age)) and assigns the same whereas the second method takes has
three parameters which are assigned to name, age and address (setInfo(name,age,address)) respectively. Ask the user to enter
details of name and age of a student. Read a character ('Y' or 'N'). If the character is 'Y' then ask the user to enter the address of the
student. Print the name, age and address of the student which are provided by the user. If the character is 'N' then print the name,
age of the student which are provided by the user and print the address value as "not available".

CODE:

import java.util.*;
class Student
{
String name;
int age;
String address;
Student()
{
name="unknown";
age=0;
address="not available";
}
void setInfo(String n, int a)
{
name=n;
age=a;
System.out.println(name+" "+age+" "+address);
}
void setInfo(String n, int a, String add)
{
name=n;
age=a;
address=add;
System.out.println(name+" "+age+" "+address);
}
}

class Que2_A3
{
public static void main(String args[])
{
Student obj1 = new Student();
Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
String name=sc.next();
int age=sc.nextInt();
char ch=sc.next().charAt(0);
if(ch=='Y'||ch=='y')
{
String address=sc.next();
obj1.setInfo(name,age,address);
}
if(ch=='N'||ch=='n')
obj1.setInfo(name,age);
}
}
